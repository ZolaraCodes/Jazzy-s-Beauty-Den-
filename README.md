# Jazzy's Beauty Den 💇🏾

This website is a landing page for a hair salon

##  What did I Learn? 🤔

This project really helped solidify my CSS (flexbox) and web design skills. I had a blast color coordinating that gradient shifting backgrounds, nav, and choosing the photos that would best represent a real ahir salon.
